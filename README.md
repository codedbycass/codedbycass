# Hi there my name is Cassandra!

## I'm a full stack engineer, designer, and community worker

📍 Based in Philadelphia

🌟 I'm passionate about digital equity, accessibility, and design. See my latest work on my [Portfolio](https://codedbycass.netlify.app/).

📧 Open to full time roles & freelance work! Let's collaborate: [Email Me](cassandramanotham@gmail.com) 

💭 I have experience in social work and an academic background in English & Environmental Studies. I approach writing code with the same skills– putting people first, thinking critically, writing clean syntax, and communicating effectively.


## Currently working on:
- A podcast website for a client
- A web based application using the MERN stack, voice memo API's, and data visualization that allows users to document their days and see their habits in retrospect. It's not a habit tracker app, but more of a self-reflection app that emphasizes documenting your day and gathering data points on yourself to learn about your habitual/unconscious habits better!
- Community building with fellow WOC developers in the Philadelphia area! [Connect with me to learn more](cassandramanotham@gmail.com)
